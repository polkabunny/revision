####Question 1
(a)
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that subclasses should be able to substitute for their base classes.
Explain how this principle may be expressed in terms of two rules that, in part, involve class invariant(s) and operation pre- and post-conditions.

######Answer:
```
This can be expressed easily in two rules:
1. Invariants (ie conditions that must remain true) of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
2. Pre- and post-conditions have specific rules of their own regarding the strength/power within subtypes:
  - Pre-conditions cannot be strengthened within a subtype.
  - Post-conditions cannot be weakened within a subtype.
```

(b)
Consider the Java code specified in the Appendix to this paper.
Explain why this code violates the LSP. Also explain how this code may cause a divide by zero to occur.

######Answer:
```
AutomaticSpeedController inherits adjustSpeed() from SpeedController but overwrites it with "do nothing". This makes the method specific to AutomaticSpeedController, meaning it can no longer be used in the smae way for SpeedController, violating the LSP. This is an issue within the Main class, as the SpeedController is initialised as a member of the AutomaticSpeedController class.

This code can cause a divide by zero as in SpeedController speed is set to 0 within the class. This is then used in timeToGo() through getSpeed() and results in the devide by zero.
```

(c)
What code changes would need to be made in order to conform to the LSP?

######Answer:
```
Remove the adjustSpeed() method from AutomaticSpeedController
```

####Question 2
(a)
Explain the main syntactical elements of the following class diagram.

######Answer:
```
Class icons for the classes - each class has room for attributes and operations for each class.
Interface for Gender - class with virtual functions with <<type>> stereotype.
Associations - associated classes have instances of related objects within them.
Dependency - the association between Person and Company relies on the Job class, and the Marriage class relies on a wife/husband association.
Multiplicity between classes is well formed - every class that is associated with another class shows a number/range of how many instances of each class can relate to the other.
```

(b)
Depict and describe, usign a non-trivial example diagram, the main features of UML sequence diagrams including highlighting when an object is computing, depiction of time constraints, return of values, creation and deletion of objects, representation of conditional behaviour and of iteration, and modelling of several threads of control.

######Answer:
```

```

####Question 3
(a)
Explain, using an exmaple, the main elements of protocol state machines. Explain also the differences between ordinary (behavioural) state machines and protocol state machines.

######Answer:
```

```

(b)
It is almost always a good principle to incorporate flexibility in a software design in order to accommodate future changes in requirements. Give brief examples (with appropriate UML diagrams) to illustrate designing for
  - adding more of the same kind of functionality
  - adding different functionality

######Answer:
```
- Adding more of the same functionality - handle multiple types of account within a banking system.
- Adding different functionality - add withdraw functionality to an existing deposit system.
```

(c)
One way to make a class more re-usable is to reduce its dependency on other classes. Provide a simple example to illustrate this.

######Answer:
```

```

(d)
Explain briefly how designing for efficiency may conflict with designing for flexibility and re-usability.

######Answer:
```
When designing for efficiency, you are not taking into account any possible changes to the functions, classes, or use of the code, this will generally result in larger classes and methods that do not retrieve function calls from inherited or extended classes. With this layout, it is harder to reuse methods and extend existing ones.
```

####Question 4
(a)
Consider the problem description.
Identify 4 use cases for the TMS and draw the corresponding Use Case diagram(s). Write clear descriptions for any 2 of the use cases indicating, in particular, user and system actions.

######Answer:
```

```

(b)
On the basis of the above problem statement and your Use Case descriptions, identify candidate domain classes for the system. You should indicate very briefly the responsibilities that you envisage for each class. Draw a corresponding class diagram indicating any significant associations between classes.

######Answer:
```

```

(c)
For any 1 of the use cases described in 4(a), present a Sequence Diagram showing how the Use Case is realised by a collaboration of some or all the classes of part 4(b). Indicate any updates to the class diagram resulting from this step.

######Answer:
```

```

####Question 5
(a)
Write a report on the group project carried out by your "continuous assessment" team for module CA314. Your report should include a precise, specific summary of the main activities and deliverables that made up your team's project. Use diagrams as appropriate and indicate particularly where elements of UML were used.

######Answer:
```

```

(b)
Indicate where your team applied Object-Oriented principles.

######Answer:
```

```

(c) Highlight those aspects of the project that you found espceciall interesting or challenging.

######Answer:
```

```

(d)
Summarise the main lessons you learned from doing the project.

######Answer:
```

```

(e)
Both of the options specified for the CA314 group project involved internet-based board games. Based on your experience of the project, outline a development framework for a family of such board games. This should include, but not necessarily be limited to, identification of features common to the games in the family, and presentation of an abstract class model for the framework.

######Answer:
```

```
