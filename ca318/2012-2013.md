Q7 In machine evolution, our chromosome is a binary string of length n. We interpret it as encoding an integer x. To convert this to encoding a real number in the interval a to b, we calculate:
      
      1. x / (2 ^ n)
      2. x / ((2 ^ n) - 1)
      3. x / (b - a)
      4. a + x (b - a)
      5. a + x / (b - a)
      6. a + (x / ((2 ^ n) - 1) (b - a))

######Answer:
```
    6. 6. a + (x / ((2 ^ n) - 1) (b - a))
```
    
Q8 In machine evolution, we have 4 individuals, where individual i has fitness f(i):

      i     1     2     3     4
      f(i)  0     -1    -2    -1
      
    If we use a "Soft max probability distribution with a "temperature" paramter T to choose who reproduces, then as T -> 0 the probability of each individual reproducing goes to:
      
      1.    0     0     1     0
      2.    0     1     1     1
      3.    0     1/4   1/2   1/4
      4.    0     1/2   0     1/2
      5.    0     1     0     1
      6.    1/4   1/4   1/4   1/4
      7.    1     0     0     0

######Answer:
```
    7.    1     0     0     0

      f(i)  0     -1    -2    -1
      
    If we use a "Soft max probability distribution with a "temperature" paramter T to choose who reproduces, then as T -> infinity the probability of each individual reproducing goes to:
      
      1.    0     0     1     0
      2.    0     1     1     1
      3.    0     1/4   1/2   1/4
      4.    0     1/2   0     1/2
      5.    0     1     0     1
      6.    1/4   1/4   1/4   1/4
      7.    1     0     0     0

######Answer:
```
    6.    1/4   1/4   1/4   1/4

Q10 In a machine evolution run, each individual has 1 set of instructions, encoded in binary format. We repeatedly select 2 parents to make 2 children by copying the 2 sets of instructions with the possibility of mutation and crossover. Let Pc be the probability of crossover between the 2 sets of instructions. Let Pm be the probability that any bit in the instructions mutates when it is inherited. Only one of the following carries out a serious search of the state space. All the others are completely constrained by whatever happens to be the initial population. i.e. Only one of the following can generate all possible genotypes, given enough time:
      
      1. Pm = 1, Pc = 1
      2. Pm = 1, Pc = 0
      3. Pm = 0, Pc = 1
      4. Pm = 0, Pc = 0
      5. Pm = 0.1, Pc = 0

######Answer:
```
    5. Pm = 0.1, Pc = 0
```
